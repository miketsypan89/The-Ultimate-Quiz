# The-Ultimate-Quiz

Here's a fun exercise to check if you're my friend or an acquaintance:)
For testing purposes, of course I'll include an answer key (But do try to go through the quiz without the key)
The answers are: 
  - B) Ukraine
  - D) Football
  - C) Ellie, Adeline, & James
  - D) Lena
  - B) 2016 Ford F-150
  - A) Antarctica
  - D) Asheville, NC

How did you do? Are you a friend of mine or just someone who only knows that I exist?
