# The-Ultimate-Quiz

Here's a fun exercise to check if you're my friend or an acquaintance:)
https://miketsypan89.github.io/The-Ultimate-Quiz/

For testing purposes, of course, I'll include an answer-key (but do try to go through the quiz without the keys)
The answers are: 
  - B) Ukraine
  - D) Football
  - C) Ellie, Adeline, & James
  - D) Lena
  - B) 2016 Ford F-150
  - A) Antarctica
  - D) Asheville, NC

Here are some examples of what the project will appear like on your desktop and/of your mobile device!

Enjoy!!

How did you do? Are you a friend of mine or just someone who only knows that I exist?:)

Either way! Great job and thank you for participating in my little project!!
